# TrackingTheProsScraper

## Presentation :

This script was part of the project : https://github.com/hanzopgp/LOLAnalysis.
I've decided to put it in a repository since I didn't find any other scaper for websites such as https://lolpros.gg/ or https://www.trackingthepros.com/ on the internet.
This scraper gets the main information (Age/Country/Server/SummonerNames etc...) of each pro players and write it in a CSV file.

## Requirements :

- python
- numpy
- selenium
- pandas
- tqdm
